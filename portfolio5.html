        <p>
            Motherboards constitute the basic parts of any computer system and come in different
            types to suit different applications as well as the form factor. The AT motherboard, an
            older large design, is quite limited in terms of expansion facilities, incorporates legacy
            bios and has less functionality in comparison to modern types. An ATX motherboard,
            which is widely used also today, has a good balance between performance and
            expandability with many PCI slots, SATA ports and a UEFI bios. When it comes to
            minitower systems smaller options like Micro-ATX and Mini-ITX can be used which
            provide a decent amount of functionality but have fewer slots and ports. With
            self-contained high performance systems in mind, the Extended-ATX provides
            additional CPU and RAM slots allowing for high performance builds. There are also LPX
            and Pico-BTX which are low-profile designs that are minimal in size but this invariably
            leads to low expandability. Each kind is suited to complete what tasks it is most
            intended for low costs systems, high end gaming or server builds.

        <p>
            Motherboards differ in size and form factor, and not to forget in the feature set they offer.
            Therefore, it would be wise to select a motherboard based on the intended use case.
            For instance, an ATX motherboard would be suited best for general-purpose and
            gaming systems since they come with abundant PCIe slots, allow multiple GPUs, and
            also boast high capacity concerning RAM. While mini-ITX motherboards save space,
            these are still reserved for minimalist builds or small-form-factor PCs when mobility or
            having limited desk space is paramount. The larger options, the Extended-ATX, are
            more likely to appeal to the pros who require more expansion slots for CPUs, more
            RAM slots, and support for expansive expansion cards. These would naturally
            constitute standard fare for workstations or server-grade configurations. With this in
            mind, users should be able to optimize the performance, space, and cost to meet their
            specific needs. <br><br>
            Other factors include the chipset and BIOS type, as these elements go a long way in
            dictating the functionality of a motherboard. Most motherboards are now equipped with
            UEFI BIOS for better security, aside from having an extremely user-friendly interface as
            opposed to legacy BIOS systems.Chipsets like Intel's Z590 or AMD's B550 support
            features such as PCIe 4.0, high-speed USB ports, and overclocking capacities that
            enthusiasts and gamers may require. On the other hand, Micro-ATX or Mini-ATX boards
            are less expensive and use less complex chipsets; therefore, they balance good
            performance with cost. Embedded features in boards can vary; these include possibly
            integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, as well as advanced cooling solutions, which have
            differences among motherboard types and are an important feature to the user
            experience. Constantly being innovated, such developments push the limits of what
            motherboards can do in delivering seamless computing experiences.
