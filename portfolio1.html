        <h2 class="portfolio-main-header">Computer Science as Discipline, Computing Disciplines and Majors | Portfolio #1</h2>
        <div class="portfolio-text">
            <h2 class="portfolio-header">Computer Science</h2>
           <p>
            Encompasses various specialties such as computer science, software engineering, and computer systems, focusing on information processing and coordination through global communication systems
            Computer science, as a discipline, emerged in the early 1940s from the convergence of algorithm theory, mathematical logic, and the invention of electronic computers. 
           </p>

           <p>
            Computer Science can be defined as three Intellectual Processes according to The Computing Curricula 1991

        <div class="portfolio-text">
            <h2 class="portfolio-header">Process of Theory</h2>
            <p>
                This computer science process is derived from the field of mathematics that functions in decision making,  conjecturing theorems as well as creating proofs that aim to verify hardware and software, analyze performance of particular designs, and establish theoretical limitations of computation.
            </p>
 
        </div>

        
        <div class="portfolio-text">
            <h2 class="portfolio-header">Process of Abstraction</h2>
            <p>
            This computer science process involves recognizing patterns, comparing and intersecting situations with one another and distill models that express common characteristics and disregarding attributes that differ from case to case. Computer scienceâ€™s focus on this process resembles that of the natural sciences, where theories are created from experimental observations.            </p>
 
        </div>

       
        <div class="portfolio-text">
            <h2 class="portfolio-header">Process of Design</h2>
            <p>
            This process is deeply interrelated with the processes of theory and abstraction. The process aims to comprehend computing's foundational ideas and potential applications. When designing systems and programs, abstract concepts, frameworks, and techniques are applied together with theoretical findings. This process is not so much about producing a specific product as it is about improving our grasp of the nature of computing.             </p>

        <div class="portfolio-text">
            <h2 class="portfolio-header">Information Systems</h2>
            <p>
                Information systems (IS) is the study of the data that computer systems can produce to support a business, nonprofit, or other entity or governmental body in establishing and accomplishing its objectives. It also addresses the procedures that a business is capable of applying and enhancing using information technologies.</p>
