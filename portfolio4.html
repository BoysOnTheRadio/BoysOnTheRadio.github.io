            <h2 class="portfolio-header">Core Components of Computer Hardware</h2>
            <p>
                <b>CPU:</b> The CPU manages computer processes and communicates with other parts of a personal computer.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>RAM:</b> RAM is a temporary storage location for data that is actively used by programs, such as when a user runs a computer application.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Motherboard:</b> The motherboard provides the structure for all other components and connects them.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Power Supply:</b> A power supply supplies electricity to all of a computer's components.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Cooling Fan:</b> Cooling fans are components of a computer's cooling system that help to prevent overheating.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Hard Drive:</b> Hard drives are data storage devices used to store files, programs, or other information on a computer system.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="portfolio-text">
            <h2 class="portfolio-header">Hardware Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Input, output, storage, and processing components are common classifications for hardware components. Peripheral devices are those that are not an essential component of the central processing unit. Typically, peripherals like a hard drive, keyboard, or printer are utilized for input, storage, or output.
            </p>
            <p>
                A device does not always need to be located outside the CPU's physical box. The best example of this is the hard disk, which is a peripheral even though it is not usually housed within the main case.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recent innovations in computer hardware include advancements in solid-state drives (SSDs), multi-core processors, and graphics processing units (GPUs). These innovations enhance speed, efficiency, and capabilities, enabling more complex computations and improved user experiences.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="portfolio-text">
            <h2 class="portfolio-header">System and Application Software</h2>
            <p>
                <b>System Software:</b> System software, such as an operating system, manages the internal operations of a computer and its peripherals, including storage devices, printers, and monitors. It operates in the background, preserving the fundamental operations of the computer so users can execute application software.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Application Software:</b> Application software directs the computer to carry out user-inputted commands. These programs handle tasks for communication, productivity, creativity, or specific business and educational purposes.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="portfolio-text">
            <h2 class="portfolio-header">Programming Languages</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Machine Language:</b> The machine-level language is a language that consists of a set of instructions in binary form (0 or 1).
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Assembly Language:</b> Assembly language contains some human-readable commands, such as `mov`, `add`, and `sub`. It reduces complexity compared to machine-level language.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>High-Level Language:</b> A high-level language allows programmers to create programs independent of a specific type of computer. Examples include C, C++, and Pascal.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="portfolio-text">
            <h2 class="portfolio-header">Implementation of Hardware in the Community</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Computers for School Performance:</b> Having a home computer is associated with higher test scores in mathematics and reading. However, children from high socioeconomic status (SES) homes achieve larger educational gains from home computers than lower SES children.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Computers in Hospitals:</b> Computers in hospitals improve healthcare delivery through systems such as Electronic Health Records (EHR), Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), and Telemedicine.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Computers for Government:</b> The government uses electronic data processing (EDP) to streamline public services, improve decision-making, and enhance monitoring.
