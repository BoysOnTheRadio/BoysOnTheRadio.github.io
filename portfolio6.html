            <h2 class="portfolio-header">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                There are various kinds of computers in the world of computing that address differing
                needs by processing power, memory, energy consumption, and intended use. From the
                personal computing devices, known as microcomputers, through to the
                high-performance systems such as servers and workstations, there is a whole variety of
                differences set by each kind of computer as it differentiates its computational
                capabilities with very different power requirements for each. Understanding these
                differences is an important step in selecting the right system for personal, professional,
                or enterprise-level tasks.

            <p>
                Mini computers are designed for moderate workloads and find applications in small to
                medium-sized business or research environments. They lie between the more powerful
                mainframes and the consumer-oriented microcomputers. Though capable of serving
                multiple users with moderate volumes of data, they do not match the incredible
                processing speeds or memory capacities of higher-level systems. Instead,
                microcomputers, also known as personal computers, are those that are most widely
                used and are suitable for general-purpose uses such as surfing the internet, playing
                games, using office applications, and watching media. These have just enough
                processing speed and memory to accommodate each day's use but do not have
                enough power for high-performance computing chores. <br><br>
                Workstations, intended for resource-intensive operations like 3D rendering, CAD, and
                scientific simulations, provide much more processing power and memory than
                microcomputers. Optimized for performance, these often come with multi-core
                processors, large memory capacities, and specialized graphics hardware. In contrast,
                servers are powerful machines responsible for network resource management, hosting
                websites, and processing large volumes of data for enterprise applications. Servers
                often support multiple users simultaneously and are designed for high availability and
                reliability, making them essential for cloud computing and business-critical operations.
                Although their power consumption is higher than that of microcomputers, their
                processing capabilities and memory are far superior, allowing them to handle extensive
                workloads across various industries.
