            <p>
                Data is the type of information computers can process and understand. It is used to store a variety of variables like numbers, words or measurements, observations or even description of items. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Data is typically stored electronically in the form of files or databases
            </p>
            <p>
                Data can come from multiple sources which includes user input, sensors or algorithms.         </p>
        </div>

        <div class="portfolio-text">
            <h2 class="portfolio-header">How Data is Stored</h2>
            <p>
                Computers represent data which encapsulates all kinds of videos, images, sounds and text using binary patterns of just two numbers: 1 and 0. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Data can be stored in file formats as in mainframe systmes using Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM) and Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM) Other file formats for data storage, conversion and processing include comma-separated values.

            <h2 class="portfolio-header">Information</h2>
            <p>
                Information is the end product of data processing, be it by analysis, contextualization, structure, interpretation, or other methods. Data gains meaning and value from information. It is essential for system designs, strategic planning, problem-solving, and decision-making. It also makes understanding, communication, and learning easier. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Information can simply be said to be processed data that has been given meaning. The data has been assigned with a context to make it meaningful.

            <h2 class="portfolio-header">Information Systems</h2>
            <p>
                An information system (IS) is an interconnected system comprising components that collect, store, process, and transmit both digital and analog information. It integrates technology, software, data, personnel, and procedures to convert raw data into actionable insights. This collaborative framework supports various business goals, including enhanced customer service and heightened productivity.       
            </p>
            <p>
                Effective information systems are critical in the modern business landscape, enabling organizations to stay competitive and responsive to market changes. Through the use of advanced analytics and real-time data processing, these systems can identify trends, predict outcomes, and support strategic decision-making.

            <h2 class="portfolio-header">How does an Information System Work?</h2>
            <p>
                Information systems (IS) is the study of the data that computer systems can produce to support a business, nonprofit, or other entity or governmental body in establishing and accomplishing its objectives. It also addresses the procedures that a business is capable of applying and enhancing using information technologies.</p>

            <h2 class="portfolio-header">Components of an Information System</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Hardware.</b> The physical components of an information system make up the hardware component. Hardware is made available for people to touch and feel. The operation of systems like computers, cellphones, and tablets is made possible by these gear, mechanisms, and wiring.
                The fundamental technological components that enable communication between people and computers and other information systems are input and output devices. Input devices include things like keyboards, mouse, microphones, and scanners, among others. Additionally, output devices could be sound and video cards, speakers, printers, monitors, and monitors. 
                
                <br> <br>

                <b>Software.</b> The intangible programs known as software are responsible for controlling input, output, processing, and storage in an information system. Applications designed for specific information system uses are operated by application software. For instance, text documents are created and edited using word processing software. One of the most widely used types of application software is the graphical user interface (GUI), which shows the data stored in computers and enables users to interact with them using digital graphics instead of text-based commands.

                <br><br>

                <b>Telecommunications.</b> Computer networks are connected by telecommunications systems, which also enable data transmission through them. Computers and storage services can also access information from the cloud over telecommunications networks. 

                <br> <br> Telecommunications networks transmit information in a variety of ways. Telephone, internet, and cable companies use coaxial and fiber optic connections to send voice, video, and data information.

            <h2 class="portfolio-header">Roles of an Information System</h2>
            <p>
                An information system's objective is to convert data into information so that knowledge that can be used to decision-making can be produced. Information needs qualities to guarantee quality in order to be valuable to a business and decision maker. The following qualities must be present in order to add value.:
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><b> Accessible:</b> Must be easily accessible by users to meet their needs in the right format at the right time. Access should be secure and prevent unauthorized access.

                <br><br>
                
                <b>Consistent:</b> Contains no discrepancies, and the same measurements or structure are used regardless of the data source.

                <br><br>

                <b>Complete:</b> Contains all information and is not missing anything.

                <br><br>

                <b>Timely:</b> Delivered when needed.

                <br><br>

                <b>Accurate:</b> Free of errors and bias, and can be verified or validated.

                <br><br>

                <b>Cost:</b> Balance the value of information to the cost of producing it.

                <br><br>

                <b>Relevant:</b> Important to decision makers.
                
                <br><br> 

                <b>Clear:</b> Not overly complex, easy to understand.

            <h2 class="portfolio-header">Support Systems</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of software engineering (SE) is to create and manage software systems that meet all client requirements, operate with efficiency and dependability, and are reasonably developed and maintained. It is significant due to the effects of costly, large-scale software systems and the function of software in applications that are essential to safety.

            <h2 class="portfolio-header">Decision Support System</h2>
            <p>
                A Decision Support System, sometimes known as a DSS, is a type of specialized information technology made to help businesses make decisions. It offers a structure for obtaining data from both internal and external sources to aid in decision-making. Although decision support systems come in a wide variety, they are typically employed to solve less structured situations.

        <div class="portfolio-text">
            <h2 class="portfolio-header">Management Information System</h2>
            <p>
                Managers benefit from the Management Information System's (MIS) assistance in automating several manual tasks. Business-related tasks include measuring and analyzing business performance, defining workflow, making business choices, and creating business plans. It also analyzes the roles and duties and gives the management feedback.     
            </p>

        <div class="portfolio-text">
            <h2 class="portfolio-header">Transaction Processing System</h2>
            <p>
                The process of collecting, altering, and retrieving transactions is automated by the Transaction Processing System (TPS). This kind of information system is unique in that it improves the efficiency, uniformity, and dependability of commercial transactions. It facilitates hassle-free daily operations for enterprises.

        <div class="portfolio-text">
            <h2 class="portfolio-header">Executive Information System</h2>
            <p>

                Similar to the MIS, but for executive-level decision-making, is the Executive Information System (EIS). The judgments require greater knowledge and judgment because they involve issues that affect the entire firm.   
            </p>
            <p>
                Compared to the DSS, the ESS offers more computer power, more efficient display options, and increased communication. With the usage of ESS, executives can effectively make judgments based on condensed internal data from MIS, DSS, and outside sources.
